# Woolf Assessment: Full-Stack Engineer

Set up a Node.js server with tRPC with a single API endpoint that accepts two PDFs: a job description and a CV. This server uses AI to analyze both files, identifying the candidate's strengths and weaknesses, and evaluates how well they align with the job description. Add basic UI using React and a framework of your choosing.

Focus on DX to ensure easy testing and usability of your solution. Include a clear README with setup and usage instructions. When done, share the repository link.
